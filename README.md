# Introduction
Welcome to Instaread - the library. Here, you can explore many genres, from the fantasy world of Game of Thrones, to the carefree world of Calvin and Hobbes. Sometimes the world between the words are more exciting than the real one. So when you're ready, pick one out and dive in!

# Getting started

Instructions:

If you would like to see the site without setting up the dev environment, I have saved screen captures under the folder site_images. Otherwise, please follow these steps:

1. Clone this repo:

   https://github.com/pinkwaffles/A-New-Angle

2. Navigate to the project and run the following:

  `npm install`

  This pulls all the dependencies from package.json and installs them.

3. Then run the following:

  `npm run build`

  This creates the React components in webpack for DOM consumption.

4. Then run:

  `npm run start`

  This starts the server, and the project is running on localhost:3000. :raised_hands:
